# **Common Questions**

When answering behavioral interview questions, focus on providing examples of situations that are specific, personal and professional. You should be able to tell a concise story in two to three minutes. By asking behavioral interview questions, interviewers want to learn more about your thought process, and the strategies and skills you use to solve problems.

Here are some common behavioral interview questions and suggestions for how to answer them categorized by topic.

## **Time management**

Employers ask questions about time management to gain an understanding of how you handle multiple responsibilities, prioritize time and delegate tasks to meet deadlines. In your response, share your thoughts around how you prioritize your to-do list. Consider highlighting your organizational skills as a tool that keeps you on track.

1. Tell me about a goal you set and reached and how you achieved it.
2. Tell me about the last time your workday ended before you were able to get everything done.
3. Give me an example of a time you had to prioritize certain tasks or projects over others.
4. Give me an example of a time when you had to handle multiple responsibilities at once. How did you prioritize your time?
5. Tell me about the last time you handle a long-term project. How did you keep the project on track?

### KPI Project (KPI Dashboard for DevOps Analytics and Reporting)

**Situation:**
During my leadership of the KPI Project, I managed a diverse team consisting of over 20 members, including co-op students, innersource contributors, and full-time employees. This project aimed to develop a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Dashboard for DevOps analytics and reporting.

**Task:**
The project involved a complex set of tasks, including designing and implementing the dashboard, ensuring data accuracy and quality, and establishing efficient workflows for data analysis and reporting. The team had to work within strict deadlines and prioritize tasks effectively to meet project milestones.

**Action:**
1. **Setting and Achieving Goals:** To manage this multifaceted project successfully, I set clear goals and objectives for the team. I ensured that each team member had a well-defined role and responsibilities, aligning them with the project's goals.

2. **Prioritization of Tasks:** As we encountered situations where multiple tasks demanded immediate attention, I applied effective task prioritization. This involved assessing the urgency and impact of each task, considering the team's capabilities, and making informed decisions on where to allocate resources.

3. **Handling Long-Term Project:** Managing a long-term project like the KPI Dashboard required meticulous planning. I created a project timeline with milestones and deadlines, breaking down the complex project into manageable phases. Regular monitoring and status reporting were essential to keep the project on track.

4. **Collaboration and Communication:** Communication was key in ensuring that everyone on the team understood their role and responsibilities. Weekly meetings allowed us to discuss progress, address challenges, and make necessary adjustments.

**Result:**
Thanks to the effective time management strategies employed throughout the KPI Project:
- We successfully met our project goals and delivered the KPI Dashboard on schedule.
- Despite the large team and numerous responsibilities, the project was efficiently coordinated.
- Our long-term project stayed on track, and the team maintained a high level of productivity.
- The project's success was attributed to our collaborative approach and effective communication.

These experiences have enriched my understanding of time management, and I have applied these skills to other projects to ensure their successful execution.

## **Adaptability**

Plans may not always work as you plan, but the ability to adjust your approach shows your resolve to succeed. Your goal when answering questions on the topic of adaptability is to demonstrate growth, even if you weren’t successful at the time.

1. Can you share about a time you had to be flexible or adaptable?
2. Tell me about a time when you had to be creative to solve a problem.
3. Tell me about a time you had to learn quickly.
4. Tell me about a time you made a difficult decision.
5. Tell me about how you work under pressure.

### Code Coverage enforcement for both EDP XL and EDP GT

In the fast-paced world of DevOps, adaptability is crucial. Demonstrating the ability to adjust and grow is a key asset when answering questions on this topic. Here's how I adapted in a specific scenario:

**Situation:**
One of the most significant adaptability challenges I faced was during the implementation of Code Coverage Enforcement. This project required in-depth knowledge of both the Enterprise DevOps Pipeline (EDP) XL and EDP GT, particularly focusing on the Continuous Integration (CI) part.

**Task:**
As a part of the project, I needed to quickly acquire a deep understanding of the CI components of EDP XL and EDP GT. This involved comprehending their intricacies and intricacies, as well as understanding how code coverage enforcement would integrate seamlessly within these pipelines.

**Action:**
1. **Learning on the Fly:** I recognized that to meet the project requirements, I had to quickly learn about EDP XL and EDP GT's CI mechanisms. I dedicated time to self-guided learning, delving into documentation and seeking advice from colleagues who were well-versed in these pipelines.
2. **Hands-on Experience:*## Adaptability* I actively engaged in practical hands-on experience. I started by working on test instances and collaborated with colleagues who provided guidance and mentorship. This hands-on approach accelerated my learning process.
3. **Problem-Solving Creativity:** To ensure seamless integration, I had to think creatively and adapt code coverage enforcement to fit within the existing CI frameworks. This required an innovative approach to problem-solving.

**Result:**
As a result of my adaptability:
- I rapidly acquired the knowledge necessary for EDP XL and EDP GT CI.
- The Code Coverage Enforcement project was successfully integrated into both pipelines.
- This adaptability and problem-solving approach contributed to achieving comprehensive code quality and coverage standards, enhancing the reliability of software produced within these pipelines.

This experience showcased my capacity to adapt, learn quickly, and creatively overcome challenges in a dynamic DevOps environment. It also demonstrated my commitment to ensuring the successful execution of projects.

1. What are the most important issues currently facing the IT industry?

The most important issues facing in the tech industry is the security threats and data protection, Which means we have to able to build a robust program as much as possible to avoid these situations. Myself experienced the data bridge last year. I was surprised that my credit card company was telling me that my personal information was lacked online.

- Why are you interested in FDM?

The reason why I am interested in FDM is because FDM not only provides necessary training, also most of its clients are in financial industry.

Due to the COVID 19, many companies decided to move online. Even through there are many companies came to Canada and offers IT position, many positions requires experience of 3 years and above. FDM creates suitable environment and experience I needed.

I tried to find my own job in many different areas and I also try to learn many different things without a target. As FDM offers a training it provides me a goal and a firm conformation that most things I will be learning will be used in future work.

I have talked with two of my friends who where and are currently working with FDM. From their reflections, even through there are drawback for this position. They do consider this position is very beneficial.

- A recent project that I am working on.

The most recent project I was working on is called HistorySpace project. I had designed and implemented a 3D virtual city (for example, Ottawa from 200 years ago) to display historical sites with storyboard composition, action creation and storytelling protocols. I also implemented a data saving mechanism, which allows user to save and share data over internet.

I have collaborate alongside with professors across multiple departments (two from computer science and one from History department). from conception and early implementation: establishing timelines and consensus from all parties around product flow, technology limitations, and goals for research.

The project was implemented using C# for graphical user interface, HelixToolkit for 3D module display, Tomcat and glassfish for servers.

## **Other Questions**

1. What are the most important issues currently facing the IT industry?

The most important issues facing in the tech industry is the security threats and data protection, Which means we have to able to build a robust program as much as possible to avoid these situations. Myself experienced the data bridge last year. I was surprised that my credit card company was telling me that my personal information was lacked online.

- Why are you interested in FDM?

The reason why I am interested in FDM is because FDM not only provides necessary training, also most of its clients are in financial industry.

Due to the COVID 19, many companies decided to move online. Even through there are many companies came to Canada and offers IT position, many positions requires experience of 3 years and above. FDM creates suitable environment and experience I needed.

I tried to find my own job in many different areas and I also try to learn many different things without a target. As FDM offers a training it provides me a goal and a firm conformation that most things I will be learning will be used in future work.

I have talked with two of my friends who where and are currently working with FDM. From their reflections, even through there are drawback for this position. They do consider this position is very beneficial.

- A recent project that I am working on.

The most recent project I was working on is called HistorySpace project. I had designed and implemented a 3D virtual city (for example, Ottawa from 200 years ago) to display historical sites with storyboard composition, action creation and storytelling protocols. I also implemented a data saving mechanism, which allows user to save and share data over internet.

I have collaborate alongside with professors across multiple departments (two from computer science and one from History department). from conception and early implementation: establishing timelines and consensus from all parties around product flow, technology limitations, and goals for research.

The project was implemented using C# for graphical user interface, HelixToolkit for 3D module display, Tomcat and glassfish for servers.

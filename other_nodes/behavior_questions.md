- Why are you interested in container team?

- A recent project that I am working on.

The most recent project I was working on is called HistorySpace project. I had designed and implemented a 3D virtual city (for example, Ottawa from 200 years ago) to display historical sites with storyboard composition, action creation and storytelling protocols. I also implemented a data saving mechanism, which allows user to save and share data over internet.

ogy limitations, and goals for research.

The project was implemented using C# for graphical user interface, HelixToolkit for 3D module display, Tomcat and glassfish for servers.
Certainly, here's a concise response to explain your interest in containers for an interview in a cheatsheet style:

"I'm interested in containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to enhance my infrastructure knowledge. Containers simplify application deployment, offer efficient resource management, and align with modern DevOps practices. They're a key tool for optimizing infrastructure, reducing costs, and accelerating development processes."
